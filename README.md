## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **Linux Mint 21.x** (Vanessa/Vera/Victoria/Virginia) or **22.x** (Wilma/Xia/Zara/Zena)
- **64-bit architecture** (with 32-bit support enabled)
- **Internet connection** for downloads
- **~2 GB free disk space** (Wine prefix + JDK + B4J)
- **sudo privileges** for system package installation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Download the script
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/b4j-wine-installer/main/install_b4j_wine.sh
chmod +x install_b4j_wine.sh
```

### 2. Run the installer
```bash
./install_b4j_wine.sh
```
> 🔐 You'll be prompted for your password when sudo is needed.

### 3. Launch B4J
- From Application Menu → Search "B4J"
- Or double-click the desktop icon
- Or run manually:
```bash
WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine_b4j" wine "C:\\Program Files\\Anywhere Software\\B4J\\B4J.exe"
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### Wine Prefix Location
```
~/.wine_b4j/  (dedicated prefix, won't interfere with default ~/.wine)
```

### Java Configuration in B4J
After first launch, verify JDK path in B4J:
1. Go to Tools → Configure Paths
2. Ensure Java Home points to: C:\Java
3. JDK should be auto-detected as version 19.0.2

### Desktop Launcher
- Location: ~/.local/share/applications/b4j-wine.desktop
- Also copied to: ~/Desktop/b4j-wine.desktop
- Icon: Downloaded from B4X website (fallback to generic if unavailable)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### B4J won't start / crashes
```bash
# Reinstall critical components in the B4J prefix
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine_b4j"
winetricks -q dotnet452 vcrun2010 gdiplus
```

### Font rendering issues
```bash
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine_b4j"
winetricks fontsmooth=rgb corefonts
wine reg add "HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop" /v FontSmoothing /t REG_SZ /d 2 /f
```

### .NET Framework errors
```bash
# Verify .NET installation
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine_b4j"
winetricks list-installed | grep dotnet
# If missing:
winetricks -q dotnet452
```

### Reset everything
```bash
# Backup first!
mv ~/.wine_b4j ~/.wine_b4j.backup
# Then re-run the installer script
./install_b4j_wine.sh
```

### Wine Mono/Gecko download failures
The script handles this automatically by downloading MSI files directly 
[linuxcapable.com](https://linuxcapable.com/how-to-install-wine-on-linux-mint/). If issues persist:
```bash
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine_b4j"
# Manual install commands are in the script (search for "wine-mono")
```
